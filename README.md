 ## Agile Methodology
 - I have used Scrum methodology for making this app
 - I planned what I should make by the end of the progam and with the help of mentors I made my plan.
 ### Plan :
 - I first made a simple react app.
 - I made a message-chat using nodejs and sockets
 - Then I started learning webrtc and made peer offer - answer  connections
 - Completed the peerConnection by passing icecandidates.
 - To the video chat app i added the feature of chat to the app.
 #### The above mentioned are my sprints during this one month period of the program.
