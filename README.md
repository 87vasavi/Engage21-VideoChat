 ## Agile Methodology
 - I have used Scrum methodology for making this app
 - With the help of mentors, I planned features that are to be implemented by the end of each sprint during the progam.
 ### Plan :
 - I first made a simple app using express.
 - I made a message-chat using nodejs and sockets.
 - Then I started learning webrtc and made peer offer - answer  connections.
 - Completed the peerConnection by passing icecandidates.
 - To the video chat app i added the feature of chat to the app.
 #### The above mentioned are my sprints during this one month period of the program.
